<lg type="poem">
    <head>Mowing</head>
<lg type="stanza">
    <l n="398">THERE was never a sound beside the wood but one ,</l>
    <l n="399">And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground .</l>
    <l n="400">What was it it whispered ? I knew not well myself ;</l>
    <l n="401">Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun ,</l>
    <l n="402">Something , perhaps , about the lack of sound —</l>
    <l n="403">And that was why it whispered and did not speak .</l>
    <l n="404">It was no dream of the gift of idle hours ,</l>
    <l n="405">Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf :</l>
    <l n="406">Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak</l>
    <l n="407">To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows ,</l>
    <l n="408">Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers</l>
    <l n="409">( Pale orchises ) , and scared a bright green snake .</l>
    <l n="410">The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows .</l>
    <l n="411">My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make .</l>

<lg type="poem">
    <head>Fire and Ice</head>
    <lg type="stanza">
        <l>Some say the world will end in fire,</l>
        <l>Some say in ice.</l>
        <l>From what I’ve tasted of desire</l>
        <l>I hold with those who favor fire.</l>
        <l>But if it had to perish twice,</l>
        <l>I think I know enough of hate</l>
        <l>To say that for destruction ice</l>
        <l>Is also great</l>
        <l>And would suffice.</l>

<lg type="poem">
    <head>Desert Places</head>
    <lg type="stanza">
        <l>Snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast</l>
        <l>In a field I looked into going past,</l>
        <l>And the ground almost covered smooth in snow,</l>
        <l>But a few weeds and stubble showing last.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza">
        <l>The woods around it have it--it is theirs.</l>
        <l>All animals are smothered in their lairs.</l>
        <l>I am too absent-spirited to count;</l>
        <l>The loneliness includes me unawares.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza">
        <l>And lonely as it is that loneliness</l>
        <l>Will be more lonely ere it will be less--</l>
        <l>A blanker whiteness of benighted snow</l>
        <l>With no expression, nothing to express.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza">
        <l>They cannot scare me with their empty spaces</l>
        <l>Between stars--on stars where no human race is.</l>
        <l>I have it in me so much nearer home</l>
        <l>To scare myself with my own desert places.</l>
